# Socia-net network app
Socia-net is a social network app where users can post, comment, like and follow other users.

## Motivation
In little more than a decade, the impact of social media has gone from being something just for fun to a fully integrated part of nearly every aspect of our daily life. Considering this, I could not resist the temptation to build one myself. I built Socia-net using Django and React, without following a tutorial. The main point of the app was to get to know Django better.
